              <p><em>“She has no time for the worries of wolves and bears, for the quarrels that foxes start with badgers…the world doesn’t have much time for these kinds of fairytales any more.”</em></p>
              <p>A soldier of metal and wire meets another like herself, only a little more human.</p>
              <p>A child talks with Death on her apartment roof.</p> 
              <p>A robot remembers nothing but the family he cares for. </p>
              <p>Faeries have eaten the world and only a few are left standing, but this isn’t the story about the end of the world. </p>
              <p>A witch plants lilies that know her well. </p>
              <p>An old woman knows the wolves that prowl the endless woods, and also the one that has come to visit… </p>

                  &ldquo;…McCosh weaves her own magic and wonder into every sentence of her story. The joy of a good retelling is in seeing someone twist and turn an old jewel and find new facets, making it sparkle in new ways under different light.&rdquo;
